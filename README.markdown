# Regional Sales EDA Project

## Description
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making for sales teams. It addresses inconsistencies in revenue and profit across U.S. regions, seasonal swings, top SKUs, and channel profitability using 5 years of historical data (2014-2018).

### Problem Statement
Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and optimize resources. This project analyzes and visualizes regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making.

### Business Questions
- Inconsistent revenue and profit performance across U.S. regions
- Lack of visibility into seasonal swings, top SKUs, and channel profitability
- Goal: Leverage 5 years of historical data to pinpoint growth levers and optimize strategy
